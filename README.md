# React & Redux examples

![Home page](./screenshots/01-index.png)

This project contains a set of examples (Todo List and Contact List) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), is a quick exercise to illustrate how to use both together. It includes the responsive CSS and HTML provided by [react-boostrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) package, so it also adapts to your viewport and device.
